This is the last of the 3 projects that I was required to do to complete my internship with CodSoft, and I chose it to be a GUI-based Password Generator using Python. Working on the previous project using Python Tkinter, intrigued me to dive deeper. This project helped me to customise my project even further and also helped me to understand the simple logic that goes behind password generation. 
This project is able to: 
1. Recieve input from the user as to how many characters they require for the password.
2. Generate a password, a combination of letters, numbers and special characters
3. Copy the password onto clipboard
